# Weather-Forecast-Application

## Description
For this application, I wanted to create a weather app that would allow a user to search for any city within the United States and get the current weather and the subsequent 5 days of weather. As the weather gets even more unpredictable, this weather app gives an easy solution to finding out the potential weather changes. This app not only allows you to search weather, but it also maintains past search results, of which you can simply click on and return to the respective weather report page. Each weather report features the city name, the date, the temperature, weather condition, and wind speed. Through this application I learned about the power of APIs and the way to search through an API to get the information that is needed. I also learned about how to get images from an API, of which I found to be the hardest part.
